Scope
---

Web report for automated tests focused on:
- showing clean results
- easy keyboard navigation
- interactive
- easy way to navigate from the results to actual test code and code tested
- suggesting code snippets according to the errors

Vision
---

TDD is the best tool I know to code whithout needing to keep big chunks of info in my own ram memory. I'm constantly looking at the documentation generated byt the test reports as a reference to: 

- copy mock data from there
- copy code from the tests
- know where the code lives and follow the stacks there

The usual jest report is a big text in the shell for each test run. The information there is not visually indexed and hard to be quick scanned. 

Having a tool to show this results in a structured way will the TDD coding cycle significantly. 

In it will consolidate multiple runs into one report, helping even more. A lot of nice interactions will be added to allow a quick keyboar navigation through the results.

Sorting, reorganizing and and renaming tests is also a proposal here. 

Roadmap
---
I started this this years and I'm slowly working on it at some nights and weekends. Some next steps I foresee: 
- ~~improving layout~~
- ~~show/hide the inner elements of a describe block when cliking over its title ("Example Tests" and "Sucessfull and nested" in the image above)~~
- ~~show what failed, the error stack and any extra information on the failing tests~~
- ~~show/hide the failing tests content~~
- ~~show loaders while tests are running~~
- add a "copy to clipboard" button to copy the test file path
- add a "copy to clipboard" button to copy file paths from the error stack
- add a "delete test run" button to delete a test and allow a quick vision of the next one. 
- show the "Describe"/"Test" aggregated result - fail or success? 
- show the "Describe"/"Test" totals
- buttons to open files in the code editor
- keyboard navigation
- show the code part where the error happened (it's not comming in the failure message)
- plugable/customizable/extensible snippets based on failed tests
- consolidating the result of multiple runs in one report allowing paralele runs (speed) and a report that unites BE and FE tests. 
- ...

How to Run it / Quick architectural overview
---

start the test server
`yarn dev`

start the test client
`yarn dev`

run the tests in the app
`yarn test`

The tests app declares a test reporter in jest.config.js:
`reporters: ['<rootDir>/jest-reporter/jest-reporter.js'],`

Then `/app/jest-reporter.js` **redirects the events to the server by calling the mutations** there as you can check on `notifyOnTestResult`.

The server exposes **subscriptions** to the clients that want to be notified. The clients will subscribe to those. 

**When the mutations are called on the server they notify the subscribed client(s).**


Foreseable Future
---

The apollo server acts as a middleware between the app that runs the tests and the browser that reduce/consolidate them. That will probably allow running multiple tests in parallel, speeding up slow test suites when needed.
